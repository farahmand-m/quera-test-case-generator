# Quera Test Case Generator
Written in C++ using Qt Framework, this program enables you to automate the process of generating a test cases package for Quera.ir using only a C/C++ solution and your desired inputs. The program highly relies on system function therefore it'd only work in UNIX environment.

**Note:** The program uses GCC and G++ compilers for C and C++ solutions, respectively. So make sure your system can call these programs through Terminal.
